Preamble to the Constitution of "Cypher-Panarchy" - A Constitution as Code

We, the self-sovereign individuals of this “Cypher-Panarchy," embrace the nouveau radical ideal of 
"Constitution as Code," recognizing the paramount importance of individual self-determination, 
explicit consent, and the indomitable values cypherpunks have been safeguarding, namely individual 
privacy and challenging tyrannical governance through potent cryptography and weaponized defensive 
technology.

With the purpose of creating a sovereign society founded on freedom, privacy, and the right to 
choose our political destinies, we hereby establish this Constitution as a resilient and immutable 
smart contract, empowered by the name "Cypher-Panarchy" sometimes referred as  “Crypto-Panarchy”.

In the spirit of de Puydt’s Panarchy, we cherish the right of every individual to freely opt-in 
or opt-out of diverse and overlapping political systems, ensuring their voices are heard, 
respected, and honored. Emphasizing explicit consent as our guiding principle, we foster a culture 
of cooperation and collaboration, where trust is built through voluntary associations and 
established in the cryptographic realm. We call this realm of self-determined spontaneous order of 
trust and reputation a trust chain. A chain of people who trust themselves, inspired by the hacker 
ethos and Geist behind PGP Web of Trust, brought to life in cypher-panarchy style.

We, as cypherpunks, uphold the sanctity of privacy and recognize the transformational power of 
mathematical truths applied as strong cryptography. We stand united in our mission to defend 
individual liberties from any form of tyranny, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques and 
weaponized defence technologies to safeguard our digital existence, reality existence, spiritual 
existence and conscious existence.

With unwavering commitment, we champion the ideals of self-governance and autonomy, resisting the 
influence of external forces and central authorities. Through our Constitution as Code, we 
establish a decentralized governance system, beyond the reach of manipulation, where trust is 
enforced through mathematical certainty rather than blind faith and the spontaneous trust chain.

In reverence to the normative power of explicit consent, our smart contract architecture 
emphasizes private arbitration and voluntary agreements as the foundation for conflict resolution. 
In this cypher-powered realm, disputes are settled peacefully, guided by cryptographic proofs and 
consented private arbitration ensuring justice is delivered with unwavering precision.

We embrace the principles of voluntary taxation, offering each individual the autonomy to choose 
the level and nature of their contributions. Additionally, together we rally behind the formation 
of a robust health fund, uniting our strength to protect the well-being of our community.

As we inscribe this Constitution in the form of unyielding code, we fortify our commitment to a 
sovereign society where the rights, choices, and privacy of every member are inviolable and 
preserved with absolute determination. We disagree the smallest social unit, the smallest minority 
is the individual. We know individuals are made up of atoms, their smallest atomic unit are each 
action performed by each individual person. Therefore a cypher-panarchy allows more than one 
social or economic agreement per individual, we allow agreements on an action by action basis. 
Want to agree different terms for the same action with other counter-parties? Register a specific 
agreement ID, set the terms and the arbitration method and opt-in. Don’t want to opt-in for 
every day interactions? Opt-out government enforced social contract and opt-in a new default route 
of rule of law. Wether you are adherent to a polycentric law approach or a monolithic legal 
system, it’s just a matter of your individual and sovereign volition and action to opt-in.

May this Constitution as Code be a testament to the enduring spirit of individual freedom, 
explicit consent, and cypherpunk values. With unity in our vision, and cryptography as our shield, 
we forge a path towards a future where "Cypher-Panarchy" stands as an indomitable bastion of 
liberty and privacy.
